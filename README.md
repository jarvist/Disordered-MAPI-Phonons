# Disordered-MAPI-Phonons

Codes and realisations of disordered Methyl-ammonium within a 1x1x1 cubic
lead-halide perovskite structure. 
These are to provide stochastic realisations of disorder, and the effect on
electronic structure, phonon broadening & etc.

A work / dataset in progress.

# Raman / disordered phonon study

As used in https://doi.org/10.1039%2Fc6cp03474h . The repeat of the Br data is
due to using a non well-optimised input (taken from another's project). 

# Thermodynamically sampled athermal structures

As used in Scott's local-field breaking paper. (Not yet submitted.)
